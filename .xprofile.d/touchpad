# >                       2.400000, 0.000000, 0.000000, \
# >                       0.000000, 2.400000, 0.000000, \
# >                       0.000000, 0.000000, 1.000000
#
# So set the sensitivity to 30%.
# TODO: Invert the effect of the pressure axis.
# - on the laptop trackpoint, increased pressure increases sensitivity
# - on the Unicomp trackpoint, increased pressure *de*creases sensitivity
